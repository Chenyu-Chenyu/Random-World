Formulation of the Problem:
There are two integers ranging from 1 to 30. Suppose Alice knows the sum of these two integers while Bob knows the product of them. 
Bob says: "I have no idea of the numbers." Alice then says: "I cannot determine them as well." 
"I get the answer!", Bob immediately follows. "I get it too!"Alice also cracks the problem. 
Question: what are the numbers given to Alice and Bob.

Algorithm:
The basic idea is to change the postulates of inferences along with the different answers. 
We get to empathize with Alice and Bob, following the information flow.
1. Bob doesn't know: xy is not a prime number.
2. Alice doesn't know: (1)x+y has several decompositions of addition. (2)Decompose x+y into any possible (x',y'), then at least two x'y' are not prime numbers.
3. Bob knows: Decompose xy in to any possible x'y', then there is only one group of (x',y') satisfying the condition 2.
4. Alice knows: Decompose x+y into any possible x'+y', then there is only one group of (x',y') satisfying the condition 3.
